<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Law Abiding Citizen</h3>
<p>Some dark parts to this film, but had me on the edge of my seat for the entire movie</p>

<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>Hilarious from start to finish. The scene where Leo is at the golf club house gets me every time!</p>

<h3>The Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>This movie gets me right in the feels.</p>
