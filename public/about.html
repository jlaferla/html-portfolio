<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Are you ever in a group environment and the first 5 minutes are spent going around to everyone and asking them to say a bit about themselves? <br>
  I genuinely detest those moments. Make me speak first and I just want the ground to swallow me up!</p>

<p>But apparently this is an "About Me" section, so I don't really have a choice on my own website! <br>
  I've been saying to myself that I want to learn how to code for a very long time but I'm quite a heavy procrastinator.<br>
  Recently, I'm attempting to reinvent myself and learning website development was one of the first things I chose to do. <br>
  So far so good but I've got so much more to learn. </p>

<p>I'm loving it so far, it's quite fun creating something. Generally, being creative isn't something that is associated with me! <br> 
  I can't wait to find out what this particular website looks like after (hopefully) hundreds of iterations. <br>
  With some time, I believe it's going to eventually look like a 'normal' website. </p>
